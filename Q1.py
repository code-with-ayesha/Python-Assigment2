# **Add two numbers**

#    Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:

#    1. Prompt the user to enter the first number.
#    2. Read the input and convert it to an integer.
#    3. Prompt the user to enter the second number.
#    4. Read the input and convert it to an integer.
#    5. Calculate the sum of the two numbers.

#    Print the total sum with an appropriate message.

#  Prompt the user to enter the first number.
first_num= int(input("Enter the first number:"))

# Prompt the user to enter the second number.
second_num= int(input("Enter the second number:"))

#  Calculate the sum of the two numbers.
total_num= first_num + second_num

#  Print the total sum with an appropriate message.
print(f"Sum of {first_num} and {second_num} is {total_num}")
